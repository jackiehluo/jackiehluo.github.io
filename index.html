          i'm interested in communities built around collaborative creation, new
          paradigms on contribution, ownership, and governance, and the
          interplay of culture and technology. i like talking about these
          topics,
          <a href="https://www.are.na/jackie-luo" target="_blank">and more</a>,
          so ping me if you ever want to think through them together.
