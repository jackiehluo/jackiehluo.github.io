                <p>My name is Jackie Luo, and I'm an engineer at <a href="http://www.squareup.com">Square</a> building Square Console on the Platform Engineering team.</p>

                <p>When I have time, I run <a href="http://www.irlsociety.com">IRL Society</a> (a monthly event series), <a href="http://www.theframeworkproject.com">The Framework Project</a> (an interview series with people thinking about tech and its impact on society), and <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jackiehluo">The Dream Machine</a> (an erratically published newsletter with my essays on technology, society, and life). Less formally, I like to <a href="http://pictures.jackieluo.com">shoot photography</a>, <a href="http://medium.com/@jackiehluo">write</a>, and cook.</p>

                <p>Before Square, I worked at <a href="http://www.nylas.com">Nylas</a> and studied philosophy at Columbia University, where I was part of <a href="http://coreatcu.com">CORE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adicu">ADI Labs</a>. Once upon a time, I ran a fashion and arts publication called <a href="https://issuu.com/achemagazine">ACHE Magazine</a> and a nonprofit called Fashion Cares.</p>
